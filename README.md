# HTML Gallery Generator Image Video
A simple configurable one level deep HTML gallery generator for images and video using Python, Galleria.IO, Bootstrap v4. The pages are generated using a dark theme.

## What it will do:
- The file will look at paths specified in configuration variable and generate either an image gallery using Galleria.io or a simple video player page. The video player page has an iFrame to the left and a list of files on the right that when clicked will play.

## What it may be useful for:
- Learning Python, Galleria and basic Bootstrap (that is what I got out of it)
- Generating HTML pages to share images and videos without requiring a webserver, although one can be used

## How to use
- Copy the script to the root folder of where your content folders are in
- Configure the PAGES, INDEX_CONTENT, and SITE_NAME variables to suit your needs
- Run the script
- Open the index.html file in your browser of choice and test the links on the NavBar

## Compatibility
